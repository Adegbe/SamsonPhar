Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).",

The gene variation may lead to a decrease in the required maintenance dose. However, as the effect on the dose is smaller than that of the normal biological variation, action is not useful.</td>\n<td>NO action is needed for this gene-drug interaction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2D6 PM</td>\n<td>risperidone</td>\n<td>The percentage of patients with therapy failure increased from 16% to 26%. The gene variation increases the plasma concentration of risperidone plus the active metabolite and increases the proportion of risperidone in this ratio, which is more effective at crossing the blood-brain barrier.</td>\n<td>Use 67% of the normal dose.
