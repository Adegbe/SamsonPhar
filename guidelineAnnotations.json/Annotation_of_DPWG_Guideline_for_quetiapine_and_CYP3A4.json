In addition, the formation of the active metabolite N-desalkylquetiapine, which is probably responsible for the antidepressant effect, should be reduced. The gene variation results in reduced activity of the enzyme CYP3A4, which converts quetiapine to N-desalkylquetiapine and an inactive metabolite.</td>\n<td>Indication DEPRESSION: choose an alternative.<br/>Aripiprazole appears to be less dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism.
