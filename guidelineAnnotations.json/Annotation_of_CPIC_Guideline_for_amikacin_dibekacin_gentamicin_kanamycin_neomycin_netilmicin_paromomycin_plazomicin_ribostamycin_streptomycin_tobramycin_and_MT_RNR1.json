Many of these agents are removed during the purification process, but some can remain as trace excipients.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>This writing group agreed that individuals with MT-RNR1 variants associated with an increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss (AIHL) should receive their vaccine schedule as normal. The rationale for this decision is threefold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The antibiotic content in vaccines is extremely low and well below the therapeutic doses associated with AIHL.1-3 For example, an influenza vaccine contains no more than 0.00015mg per dose. Although prescribing regimens vary depending on the clinical context and local guidance, a typical dose of gentamicin in neonatal sepsis is 5mg/kg every 24-36 hours.4-7 Therefore, a 3kg newborn might receive a 15mg daily dose of gentamicin intravenously; a 100,000 order of magnitude greater quantity than found in the vaccine. As such, the possibility that such small quantities of aminoglycosides contained in vaccines could cause AIHL is extremely low and, at best, theoretical.</li>\n<li>The CPIC guidelines for the use of aminoglycosides for individuals with the MT-RNR1 genotype state that, in individuals with risk-conferring MT-RNR1 variants, aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided unless the risk of AIHL is outweighed by the risk of not providing that antibiotic therapy, without safe or effective alternative therapies. In this clinical scenario, the guideline writing group agree that the extremely low theoretical risk of AIHL from vaccines is greatly outweighed by the benefits of vaccination.</li>\n<li>The frequency of the most common risk-conferring MT-RNR1 variant, m.1555A&gt;G, is sufficiently high that is reasonably likely that if there was a signal to be observed, this would have been identified given the almost ubiquitous nature of this intervention.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>In conclusion, the CPIC MT-RNR1 writing group agree that presence of MT-RNR1 variants associated with an increased risk of AIHL should not impact routine vaccination schedules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Download and read <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CPIC_Update_Final_V3.0.docx\" target=\"_blank\">the full update text</a></p>\n<p>In addition, the guideline recommendations were extended to cover dibekacin, neomycin, netilmicin and ribostamycin. Links to drug resource mapping files and to pre- and post-test alerts for these new drugs have been added below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"june-2021\">June 2021</h3>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2309\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; guideline for aminoglycosides and MT-RNR1</a> has been published in <em>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</em>. The authors of the guideline evaluated the available evidence for the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics in patients carrying certain <em>MT-RNR1</em> variants.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>These guidelines are applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;The critical pharmacogenetics recommendation for a person with an <em>MT-RNR1</em> variant which predisposes to AIHL is that aminoglycoside antibiotics are relatively contraindicated, meaning that aminoglycosides should be avoided unless the increased risk of hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe or effective alternative therapies&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the adverse drug reaction may be more profound with some members of the aminoglycoside class than others. As such, this guidance covers all aminoglycoside antibiotics irrespective of class. We provide a strong recommendation that carriers of MT-RNR1 variants that predispose to AIHL should avoid aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the risk of infection without safe or effective alternative therapies&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;If no effective alternative to an aminoglycoside is thought to be available, we advise use for the shortest possible time, consultation with an infectious disease expert for alternative approaches, therapeutic drug monitoring and frequent assessment for hearing loss, both during and after therapy, in consultation with an audiovestibular physician.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;An individual with no detectable MT-RNR1 variant or carrying MT-RNR1 variants not considered to be predisposing to AIHL (normal risk), including the m.827A&gt;G variant, should still be considered at risk of AIHL.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"
