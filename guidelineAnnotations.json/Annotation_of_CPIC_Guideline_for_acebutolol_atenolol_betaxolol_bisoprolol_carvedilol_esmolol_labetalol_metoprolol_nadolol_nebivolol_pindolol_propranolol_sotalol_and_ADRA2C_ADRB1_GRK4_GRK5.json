They conclude that there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice at this time.</p>\n<p>These guidelines are applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>ADRB1 encodes the beta-1 adrenoreceptor, which is antagonized by both “beta-1 selective” (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol) and “non-selective” (e.g., carvedilol, labetalol, propranolol) beta-blockers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>In ADRB1, p.Ser49Gly and p.Gly389Arg are among the most studied variants [...]. [T]he current evidence does not consistently support that these variants affect either beta-blocker dosage requirements or response as indicated by heart rate, blood pressure, or echocardiographic measures in patients. The data related to ADRB1 and the clinical outcomes of beta-blocker treated patients are more conflicting, particularly in heart failure (the patient population most studied). However, the writing committee noted a trend in the clinical outcomes evidence, depending on whether the studies evaluated beta-blocker response by dose level vs. as a binary variable (i.e., beta-blocker treatment yes/no). Of the studies that reported significant associations between p.Gly389Arg and cardiovascular outcomes, nearly all of them analyzed beta-blocker response by dose level in their analyses. Patients with the p.389Arg/Arg genotype experienced significantly worse outcomes than those with other genotypes when treated with low-dose beta-blockers, but no similar associations were observed at higher doses (41-43). On the other hand, almost no studies that analyzed beta-blocker use as a binary variable (yes/no) reported p.Gly389Arg associations with clinical outcomes. Thus it is possible that, if beta-blocker-mediated cardiovascular outcomes differ by p.Arg389Gly genotype, titration to goal beta-blocker doses could abrogate the effect. However, this dose-related trend was primarily observed in post hoc analyses of non-randomized studies. Given the current available evidence, the writing committee concluded that additional research is needed to further confirm or refute this dose-related observation before any clinical recommendations could be made (CPIC level C-no recommendation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Even fewer studies were available related to individual variants in ADRA2C, GRK4 and GRK5 and their associations with beta-blocker response. Thus, no clinical recommendations were provided for individual variants in ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, or GRK5 (CPIC level C-no recommendation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>While some studies reported additive effects of various combinations of variants in pharmacodynamic genes, the writing committee found insufficient evidence to make clinical recommendations regarding any of these variant combinations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/beta_blockers/2024/38951961.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Guideline publication</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/beta_blockers/2024/38951961-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Guideline supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
