Therefore, no dosing recommendations are provided for venlafaxine for CYP2D6 UMs.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;When administered similar doses, CYP2D6 PMs had significantly greater drug exposure or parent to metabolite ratios for paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine when compared to NMs (Table S1). Increased drug exposure increases the risk for dose/concentration-dependent side effects. Data for venlafaxine suggest increased concentration-dependent side effects in CYP2D6 PMs (Table S2). The paucity of prospective studies, uncommon clinical use of therapeutic drug monitoring for antidepressants, and the potential that decreasing the dose may compromise medication efficacy was the basis for the optional recommendation to consider alternatives to venlafaxine in CYP2D6 PMs.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The FDA Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations lists venlafaxine and vortioxetine as drugs warranting dose adjustments in CYP2D6 PMs.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; Guideline for for <em>CYP2D6</em>, <em>CYP2C19</em>, <em>CYP2B6</em>, <em>SLC6A4</em>, and <em>HTR2A</em> Genotypes and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2023 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">CYP2D6 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/venlafaxine-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Venlafaxine Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/venlafaxine_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Venlafaxine Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Venlafaxine_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Venlafaxine CDS Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-venlafaxine-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for venlafaxine based on CYP2D6 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2c of the guideline.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Activity score<br/>range</th>\n<th>Activity score</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic<br/>Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of<br/>recommendation<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td><em>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN<sup>c</sup></em></td>\n<td>Increased metabolism of venlafaxine to the active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (desvenlafaxine) and increased O-desmethylvenlafaxine : venlafaxine ratio as compared to CYP2D6 normal metabolizers.
