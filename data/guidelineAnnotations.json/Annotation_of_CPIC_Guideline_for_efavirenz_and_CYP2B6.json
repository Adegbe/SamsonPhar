      "html" : "<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Pediatrics:\nEfavirenz is FDA-approved for use as part of antiretroviral therapy in children = 3 months of age and weighing = 3.5 kg. In the U.S. efavirenz is available as capsules (50 or 200 mg); tablets (600 mg); a fixed dose combination comprised of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg and  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; and more recently a fixed dose combination called Symfi Lo® (efavirenz 400 mg,  lamivudine 300 mg, and  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) for children weighing = 35 kg. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection recommends efavirenz in combination with two-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as an alternative non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimen for initial treatment of HIV in children aged = 3 years.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Children age &lt; 3 years. similar to DHHS guidelines, we do not recommend use of efavirenz in infants and children aged 3 months to &lt; 3 years, except under special circumstances such as tuberculosis co-infection. If a clinical situation requires use of efavirenz in this age group, CYP2B6 testing may be informative and dosing could be guided by the current DHHS guidelines, which were  informed by  IMPAACT study P1070 (36). The guidelines recommended an efavirenz dose reduction based on weight groups for CYP2B6 poor (c.516T/T) metabolizers: 5 kg to &lt; 7 kg: 50 mg; 7 kg to &lt; 14 kg: 100 mg; 14 kg to &lt; 17 kg: 150 mg; and = 17 kg: 150 mg.  Dosing for normal (c.516G/G) metabolizers and intermediate (c.516G/T) metabolizers is as follows: 5 kg to &lt; 7 kg: 300 mg; 7 kg to &lt; 14 kg: 400 mg; 14 kg to &lt; 17 kg: 500 mg; and = 17 kg: 600 mg. Although current DHHS guidelines for efavirenz dosing in pediatrics do not consider c.983T&gt;C, we recommend that dosing recommendations for c.516T/T also be applied to c.516T/c.983C and to c.983C/C. We also recommend measuring plasma efavirenz concentrations two weeks after initiation. The mid-dose plasma efavirenz concentration target of 1 to 4 mg/L derived from adult clinical monitoring data is typically also applied to trough concentrations in pediatric patients. &quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Children age &gt; 3 years and weighing &lt; 40 kg. While the effect of CYP2B6 genotype on efavirenz exposure has been demonstrated in children older than three years of age who weigh less than 40 kg, specific clinical data supporting CYP2B6 genotype-guided dosing are limited. Thus, although we cannot make a firm recommendation for dose adjustment based on CYP2B6 genotype in this age and weight group, CYP2B6 genotype almost certainly affects efavirenz exposure in these children such that efavirenz dose reduction in CYP2B6 poor metabolizers would also be reasonable. Therapeutic drug monitoring, where available and accessible, could help guide dosing adjustments in this age/weight group, especially in a setting of potential drug-related toxicity, virologic rebound, or lack of response in an adherent patient. For pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more, adult dosing applies (see Table 2).&quot;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Most studies have examined the impact of <em>CYP2B6</em> c.516G&gt;T and c.983T&gt;C; therefore, these variants provide the basis for our clinical recommendations.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Multiple studies have shown that the CYP2B6 poor metabolizer genotype, particularly defined by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for <em>CYP2B6</em> c.516G&gt;T and/or c.983T&gt;C, is associated with decreased efavirenz clearance and increased risk for efavirenz toxicity (particularly CNS toxicity, hepatic injury, and QTc prolongation) and/or treatment discontinuation, although some studies have not shown such an association.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Based on current evidence, CYP2B6 normal metabolizers (NMs) are expected to have normal efavirenz metabolism and achieve therapeutic efavirenz concentrations with standard dosing (600 mg/day). CYP2B6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) may experience higher dose-adjusted trough concentrations compared with NMs, which may put these patients up to a 1.3-fold increased risk of adverse effects. For these patients, there is a “moderate” recommendation to consider initiating efavirenz with a decreased dose of 400 mg/day. CYP2B6 poor metabolizers (PMs) are at greatest risk for higher dose-adjusted trough concentrations compared with NMs and IMs, and greater overall plasma efavirenz exposure, which puts these patients up to a 4.8-fold increased risk for adverse effects and treatment discontinuation. For these patients, there is a “moderate” recommendation to consider initiating efavirenz with a decreased dose of either 400 or 200 mg/day.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;CYP2B6 RMs and UMs may experience slightly lower dose-adjusted trough concentrations of efavirenz compared with normal metabolizers, which may be clinically important for efavirenz. However, based on current evidence, the effect of the increased function alleles CYP2B6*4 and *22 appears to be modest. As such, current data are not sufficient to recommend a change from normal prescribing at this time, and patients with the RM or UM phenotype should receive standard efavirenz dosing.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Pediatrics:\nEfavirenz is FDA-approved for use as part of antiretroviral therapy in children = 3 months of age and weighing = 3.5 kg.

Although current DHHS guidelines for efavirenz dosing in pediatrics do not consider c.983T&gt;C, we recommend that dosing recommendations for c.516T/T also be applied to c.516T/c.983C and to c.983C/C.
