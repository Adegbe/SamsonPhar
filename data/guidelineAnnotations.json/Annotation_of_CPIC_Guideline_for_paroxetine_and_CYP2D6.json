This is an update to the previous CPIC&reg; guideline for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"february-2023\">February 2023</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The 2015 CPIC&reg; guideline for for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> has been updated to include additional genes and drugs. It is now known as the CPIC&reg; guideline for <em>CYP2D6</em>, <em>CYP2C19</em>, <em>CYP2B6</em>, <em>SLC6A4</em>, and <em>HTR2A</em> Genotypes and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants. Literature pertaining to paroxetine and <em>CYP2D6</em> published between January 2015 to June 2022 was reviewed and the recommendations and supplemental information were updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;In multiple studies, CYP2D6 UMs had low or undetectable plasma concentrations of paroxetine (31-34) and vortioxetine (35) when compared to NMs (31-34). Those with undetectable or low plasma concentrations had a lower probability of clinical benefit, although the minimal effective paroxetine therapeutic concentration is not well-defined (36).&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;When administered similar doses, CYP2D6 PMs had significantly greater drug exposure or parent to metabolite ratios for paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine when compared to NMs (Table S1). Increased drug exposure increases the risk for dose/concentration-dependent side effects (37). To potentially prevent  adverse effects, dose extrapolations based on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between phenotype groups suggest a 50% dose reduction of paroxetine.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These guidelines are applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric consideration: &quot;Citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline had the most pharmacogenetic data supporting potential genotype-guided prescribing changes in children. Based on this evidence, the recommendations for these drugs are relevant to pediatric patients and are consistent with smaller pharmacokinetic studies available for this population.&quot; ..... &quot;The generalizability of other recommendations to pediatric patients needs to be established. As such, clinicians treating children and adolescents should determine their applicability to younger patients while considering the unique and more limited evidence base for these medications in youth, as well as pediatric-specific differences in tolerability (e.g., activation)and disorder-specific response trajectory.

CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table, CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diplotypes giving rise to activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer assignments.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> Because the recommendations in this guideline do not differ between a CYP2D6 normal and intermediate metabolizer, the current published recommendations for normal and intermediate metabolizers will remain unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower value of 0.25 for *10). Prior to the consensus projects, the combination of a duplicated normal function allele with a *10 allele resulted in an activity score of 2.5 which translates to an ultrarapid metabolizer. The lower value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10 results in an activity score of 2.25 for these allele combinations, which based on the consensus project translates to a normal metabolizer.
