CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table, CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table, Atomoxetine pre- and post-test alerts and flow chart (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> The current guideline has a specific recommendation for AS of 1 (no CYP2D6*10 allele present); thus, the current published recommendations for normal and intermediate metabolizer will remain unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower activity value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10).

Atomoxetine exposure (AUC) is, on average, 10-fold higher in CYP2D6 PMs compared to non-PMs. .... Individuals with two CYP2D6*10 alleles had higher atomoxetine exposure (5-fold higher peak concentration) when compared to individuals with at least one normal function allele.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The most well studied pharmacokinetic parameter for atomoxetine relates plasma drug concentrations that approximate the Cmax of the parent compound to reduction of ADHD symptoms. Given this evidence, the therapeutic recommendation for each CYP2D6 phenotype class also includes guidance for plasma drug concentration testing, as a means to estimate atomoxetine exposure (i.e. exposure check).

For a complete list of CYP2D6 diplotypes and resulting phenotypes, see the CYP2D6 Genotype to Phenotype Table <a href=\"https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">CYP2D6 tables</a>. Note that genotypes with an activity score of 1 are classified as NMs in the online CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table.<br />\n<sup>c</sup> Rating scheme described in Supplement.<br />\n<sup>d</sup> Where xN represents the number of CYP2D6 gene copies. For individuals with CYP2D6 duplications or multiplications, see supplemental data for additional information on how to translate diplotypes into phenotypes.<br />\n<sup>e</sup> Therapeutic range of 200 to 1000 ng/ml has been proposed [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/29493375\">29493375</a>].<br />\n<sup>f</sup> Limited data are available regarding the relationship between atomoxetine plasma concentrations and clinical response.  Available information suggests that clinical response is greater in PMs compared to non-PMs and may be related to the higher plasma concentrations 1 to 1.5 hours after dosing in PMs compared to non-PMs administered a similar dose.  Furthermore, modest improvement in response, defined as reduction in ADHD-RS, is observed at peak concentrations greater than 400 ng/ml.<br />\n<sup>g</sup> Doses above 120 mg/day have not been evaluated.<br />\n<sup>h</sup> Patients with an activity score of 1.0 may be classified as intermediate metabolizers by some reference laboratories. A group of CYP2D6 experts are currently working to standardize the CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype translation system. CPIC will update the CPIC website accordingly.<br />\n<sup>i</sup> CPIC has general classified patients with activity score of 1 as “normal metabolizer.” However, in the case of atomoxetine, prescribing recommendations for those with an AS of 1.0 are allele-dependent, based on the presence of the CYP2D6*10 allele.</p>\n",
