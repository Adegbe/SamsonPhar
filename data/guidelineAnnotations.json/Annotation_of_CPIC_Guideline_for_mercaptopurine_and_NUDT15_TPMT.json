The approach to dosing adjustments based on TPMT status may differ depending on the clinical indication and the propensity to initiate therapy at higher vs. lower starting doses. We and others advocate testing for TPMT status prior to initiating thiopurine therapy, so that starting dosages can be adjusted accordingly.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a download=\"cpic-tpmt-article.pdf\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/cpic-tpmt-article.pdf\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guidelines for Thiopurine Methyltransferase Genotype and Thiopurine Dosing</a></li>\n<li><a download=\"cpic-tpmt-supplement.pdf\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/cpic-tpmt-supplement.pdf\">2011 supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
