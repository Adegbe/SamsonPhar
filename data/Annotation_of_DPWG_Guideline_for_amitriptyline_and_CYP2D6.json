Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).",

Choose an alternative if possible. Antidepressants that are not metabolised via CYP2D6 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, citalopram and sertraline.<br/>2. If an alternative is not an option: use 50% of the standard dose and monitor the plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. As side effects are related to nortriptyline plasma concentrations and the efficacy to amitriptyline plus nortriptyline plasma concentrations, which are influenced to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, it is not known whether it is possible to reduce the dose to such an extent that the side effects disappear, but the efficacy is maintained.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"2011-guideline\">2011 Guideline</h3>\n<p>The Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association - Pharmacogenetics Working Group has evaluated therapeutic dose recommendations for amitriptyline based on CYP2D6 genotypes [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/21412232\">21412232</a>].
