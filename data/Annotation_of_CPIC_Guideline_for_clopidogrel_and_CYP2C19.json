However, there are accumulating data showing a similar relationship between CYP2C19 no function alleles and clopidogrel response when it is used for other indications, including treatment of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). These data, in combination with strong pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, support the use of CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy when considering clopidogrel for neurovascular indications.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The clinical data on which this guideline is based were obtained from studies in adults. Given the well-characterized pharmacokinetic basis for this gene-drug interaction and the presence of fully mature CYP2C19 enzyme activity after 2-3 months of age, it is reasonable to extrapolate the recommendations presented in this guideline to pediatric patients if needed.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/clopidogrel/2022/35034351.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; Guideline for for CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel therapy: 2022 update</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/clopidogrel/2022/35034351-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2022 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials\">CYP2C19 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/clopidogrel-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Clopidogrel Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/clopidogrel_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Clopidogrel Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Clopidogrel_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Clopidogrel Clinical Decision Support Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-antiplatelet-therapy-recommendations-based-on-cyp2c19-phenotype-when-considering-clopidogrel-for-cardiovascular-indications\">Table 1: Antiplatelet therapy recommendations based on CYP2C19 phenotype when considering clopidogrel for <strong>cardiovascular indications</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2022 guideline update.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Genotype</th>\n<th>Examples of genotypes</th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations<sup>a</sup>- ACS and/or PCI<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations<sup>a</sup> - non-ACS, non-PCI cardiovascular indications<sup>c</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two increased function alleles</td>\n<td>*17/*17</td>\n<td>Increased clopidogrel active metabolite formation; lower on-treatment platelet reactivity; no association with higher bleeding risk</td>\n<td>If considering clopidogrel, use at standard dose (75 mg/day)</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>No recommendation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying one normal function allele and one increased function allele</td>\n<td>*1/*17</td>\n<td>Normal or increased clopidogrel active metabolite formation; normal or lower on-treatment platelet reactivity; no association with higher bleeding risk</td>\n<td>If considering clopidogrel, use at standard dose (75 mg/day)</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>No recommendation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 normal metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two normal function alleles</td>\n<td>*1/*1</td>\n<td>Normal clopidogrel active metabolite formation; normal on-treatment platelet reactivity</td>\n<td>If considering clopidogrel, use at standard dose (75 mg/day)</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 likely intermediate metabolizer<sup>d</sup></td>\n<td>An individual carrying one normal function allele and one decreased function allele or one increased function allele and one decreased function allele or two decreased function alleles</td>\n<td>*1/*9, *9/*17, *9/*9</td>\n<td>Reduced clopidogrel active metabolite formation; increased on-treatment platelet reactivity; increased risk for adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events</td>\n<td>Avoid standard dose clopidogrel (75 mg) if possible.
