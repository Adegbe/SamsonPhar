Adjustment of the initial dose should be performed based on toxicity (monitoring of the blood counts) and efficacy. Monitoring should be performed at an increased frequency.<br/>NOTE: The percentage of 75% is based on the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15.<br/>NOTE: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.<br/>- LEUKAEMIA: start with 75% of the standard tioguanine dose or start with the standard dose and reduce to 75% if side effects necessitate a dose reduction. It is not known whether dose reduction in advance results in the same efficacy as dose reduction based on toxicity. Adjustment of the initial dose should be performed based on toxicity (monitoring of the blood counts) and efficacy.

Monitoring should be performed at an increased frequency.<br/>NOTE: The percentage of 10% is based on the analogy with azathioprine and mercaptopurine and the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15.
