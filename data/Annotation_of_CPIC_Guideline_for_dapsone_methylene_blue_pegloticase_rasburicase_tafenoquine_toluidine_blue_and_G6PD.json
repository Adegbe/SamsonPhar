As part of this guideline, the authors classified drugs by their risk of causing acute hemolytic anemia (AHA) in patients with G6PD deficiency. Dapsone, methylene blue, pegloticase, rasburicase, tafenoquine and toluidine blue have been classified as <strong>high risk drugs</strong>, as shown in Table 2 of the guideline publication. This guideline replaces the original 2014 guideline for G6PD and rasburicase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These guidelines are applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;An additional step was added to this CPIC guideline to assign drugs into three groups: those that can be considered high risk for AHA in the presence of G6PD deficiency (and thus should generally be avoided), those that are considered medium risk in G6PD deficiency (and thus should be used with caution), and those that can be considered low-to-no risk (with no added risk of AHA in those that are deficient for G6PD versus those with normal G6PD status).&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;In order to assign drugs into risk groups, the authors considered not only the strength of the evidence in the primary peer-reviewed literature, but also the frequency of drug use, the presence of regulatory agency warnings, and the presence or absence of a mechanism by which\nreactive oxygen species might be generated and contribute to hemolysis in G6PD deficiency (Supplement, Assigning Risk Level)&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;<strong>Rasburicase and pegloticase (high risk drugs)</strong>\n<em><strong>Risk category for rasburicase and pegloticase in G6PD deficiency</strong></em> Based on literature strength (high level of evidence) linking AHA and methemoglobinemia to use of the drugs in the setting of G6PD deficiency (Table S1), the mechanism of action of urate oxidase (generation of\nhydrogen peroxide) (31), and strong, consistent regulatory warnings (Table S3), rasburicase and pegloticase are considered to be in the high risk category.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>Therapeutic recommendations.</strong></em>_ As high risk drugs, rasburicase and pegloticase should be avoided in patients with G6PD deficiency (Table 3). However, as for any drug, the risk of the adverse effects (AHA and/or methemoglobinemia) must be weighed against the risk of\nhyperuricemia, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed malignancies in whom tumor lysis is anticipated. Tumor lysis syndrome itself can be life-threatening, and alternative uric acid lowering therapy, such as allopurinol, may not be as efficacious as rasburicase at lowering uric acid levels, and has other potential adverse effects.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"

Class I variants are extremely rare; the distinction between class II and III variants is not clear; and the &quot;class V&quot; very high activity variant has only been reported in a single case [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/4963040\">4963040</a>]. Therefore, almost all patients will carry class II, III, or IV alleles. It should be noted that the class of a variant may have been assigned only by the clinical manifestations of a patient in which the variant was subsequently identified.</p>\n<p>(*) Luzzatto, L. &amp; Poggi, V.
